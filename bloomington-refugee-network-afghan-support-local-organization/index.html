              The Afghan refugees in this story requested to be identified by
              pseudonyms due to risks of their identity being tracked by the
              Taliban. The IDS took non-identifying photos of the subjects to
              have a visual element to the story without risking the safety of
              the subjects.

            Pete Lenzen, 71, director of Bloomington Refugee Support Network, started his
            day with a coffee and pastry from Hive before driving seven Afghan refugees to
            their dental appointments in Indianapolis. He turned left out of the Hive
            parking lot and pulled up to the front doors of the Tulip Tree apartments to
            pick up his first client, 27-year-old Zahra.

          <p>At 11:18 a.m. he texted her.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;We are outside now.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;Coming,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Do I need any documentation?&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Only ID,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Insurance.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Ok.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>
            After getting into the front seat of Lenzen&lsquo;s white 2024 Chrysler Pacifica,
            Zahra rode along to the next stop — an Afghan family&lsquo;s home on the west side
            of Bloomington. Lailoma, 52, and four of her six children piled in, with all
            four kids cramming into the back three seats of the van.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lailoma and Zahra greeted each other in Persian. They have all met several
            times before, as Lenzen always made a point to introduce Afghan families to
            each other who came to Bloomington as refugees.
          </p>
          <p>&ldquo;Hello, good morning!&rdquo; Lailoma said to Lenzen.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; he said.</p>
          <p>
            Lailoma and her third eldest son, Amir, 17, had appointments. Sorosh, 15,
            Freshta, 12, and Mehronaz, 10, came along for the ride. Lenzen thought it was
            good for the other kids to join so they could be exposed to different
            surroundings.
          </p>
          <p>
            They began the nearly hour-long drive to Familia Dental, an office chosen by
            Lenzen because of its Medicaid insurance advertisement. Lenzen said for
            families coming to America to start over, appointments in Bloomington tend to
            be difficult to schedule and much more expensive. His goal for the families is
            to help them reach financial independence. He is committed to helping them in
            the meantime.

            <figcaption>
              The clients arrive at Familia Dental in Indianapolis on Feb. 22, 2025. Lenzen chose to take his clients here because it offers cheaper services to low-income families than dental offices in Bloomington.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            When Lenzen was a U.S. Navy Officer in 1981, he spent time helping to rescue
            men, women and children who were fleeing Vietnam by boat. He later went on to
            work with the United Nations in Seoul, South Korea. There, he joined Mother
            Teresa Missionaries of Charity to help abandoned women and children.
          </p>
          <p>
            When he returned to the U.S., he worked in various factories across the
            country but eventually settled in Bloomington with his family when he retired
            in 2016; the same year Diane Legomsky founded RSN.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lenzen learned about the organization and quickly decided to join as a board
            member to give back to his community. He became the director in 2021. Through
            RSN, he and about 20 other volunteers have helped over 200 families find their
            footing in the U.S. after fleeing persecution from their home countries.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to a report from the Office of Homeland Security Statistics, 60,050
            refugees were admitted into the country during 2023, the same year Zahra came
            to the U.S. On Jan. 20, President Donald Trump signed an executive order
            suspending the United States Refugee Admissions Program for 90 days. U.S.
            District Judge Jamal Whitehead ruled to block Trump&lsquo;s executive order on Feb.
            25. However, The Associated Press <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-refugee-program-lawsuit-resettlement-32450958d47f31fc1bbbe5a196d32377"
            target="_blank">reported</a> Feb. 27 that refugee aid groups
            said their &ldquo;cooperative arguments with the State Department had been
            cancelled,&rdquo; claiming the Trump administration is trying to
            &ldquo;circumvent&rdquo; the court order.
          </p>
          <p>
            For Zahra and Lailoma&lsquo;s family, leaving Afghanistan for the United States may
            have saved their lives.
          </p>
          <p class="section-break">•••</p>
          <p>
            Zahra was a student at American University of Afghanistan in Kabul when the
            Taliban attacked in August 2021. The university was one of the first targets
            of the Taliban because they thought the students were being converted to
            Christianity by Americans. Zahra was instructed to evacuate at midnight
            without saying goodbye to her family. She didn&lsquo;t want them to worry, so she
            told them she was safe and turned off her phone to avoid the possibility of
            being tracked by the Taliban.
          </p>
          <p>
            She worked as a resident assistant at a female dormitory when they came. The
            president of the university asked her and four of her female colleagues to
            burn as many documents as they could to protect themselves and the rest of the
            students. She had to leave behind any trace of her life in Afghanistan if she
            wanted to stay safe.
          </p>
          <p>
            The students arrived at a camp in Kabul where they were told they would remain
            safe. But just eight hours after the Taliban came to Kabul, the students were
            found and held as hostages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Zahra said the students never interacted with the members of the Taliban
            because security guards stood in the way, but they were not allowed to leave
            until the Taliban received a bargain. Zahra never knew what it was they
            wanted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each night for a week the nearly 450 hostages were told they would be escorted
            to the airport. They were each forced to stand in a line with only a backpack
            including one outfit, their passports and one laptop from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m.
            before being told to go back to their rooms. Every night, Zahra hoped they
            would be set free.
          </p>
          <p>
            After seven days, the Taliban escorted them to the airport but took photos and
            videos of each Afghan who chose to leave. The recordings signaled their
            consent for the Taliban to kill them if they ever returned.
          </p>
          <p>
            She got a flight to Qatar and traveled to Kurdistan, Iraq, where she lived for
            a year and a half continuing her studies and waiting for her U.S. visa to be
            approved. Zahra arrived in Bloomington in January 2023 through 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.exodusrefugee.org/">Exodus Refugee
            Immigration</a> and enrolled at IU to complete her undergraduate degree in
            economics. She now texts with her family who are still in Afghanistan every
            morning and calls them at least once a week.
          </p>
          <p>
            Zahra first met Lenzen about two months after resettling in Bloomington
            through a mutual friend who he previously helped with resettlement. Zahra
            needed a ride to her early morning medical check-up. Lenzen took the
            opportunity to assess her needs as a new refugee in the United States, like
            with all his clients. He helps them buy groceries, set up utilities, pay rent
            and assist with any medical needs.
          </p>

            When Lailoma&lsquo;s family came to the U.S. through Exodus in January 2024, they
            spoke little English and didn&lsquo;t have many resources. In Afghanistan, Lailoma&lsquo;s
            husband, Zahid, 48, was a professional musician, but the Taliban did not
            respect musicians. He also helped women learn to play music and worked with
            Americans, two other reasons the Taliban disrespected Zahid specifically. They
            left to not only protect themselves, but the family they had to leave behind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once they obtained their documents, they flew to Chicago, then to Indianapolis
            and received a ride from the airport to Bloomington. They stayed two weeks in
            the Homewood Suites hotel before finding permanent housing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lailoma and Zahid met Lenzen through other Afghan families settled in
            Bloomington who worked with him in the past. The families told them Lenzen was
            like an angel. Lailoma and Zahid needed help setting up a wi-fi network, but
            after several attempts trying to figure it out, they called Lenzen. He also
            helped them find a TV for the kids, a computer for work and school and has
            taken them several times to the grocery store and medical appointments.
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;Without Pete (Lenzen), it was difficult to live here,&rdquo; Zahid
            said.
          </p>
          <p class="section-break">•••</p>
          <p>
            The van was kept clean for Lenzen&lsquo;s passengers, except for the salt stains on
            the floor mats and fingerprints on the air vents. A half-full drink from
            Wendy&lsquo;s was left in the cup holder behind the front passenger seat, still
            frozen from being left in the van overnight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Amir had headphones around his neck and Sorosh kept one AirPod in his right
            ear. The girls downloaded a piano tiles music app on their mother&lsquo;s phone to
            keep them busy, with the song &ldquo;Please Please Please&rdquo; by Sabrina
            Carpenter escaping from the speakers.
          </p>
          <p>
            They arrived at Familia Dental just before 1 p.m., which was the time of
            Lailoma and Amir&lsquo;s appointments. Zahra&lsquo;s appointment wasn&lsquo;t until 2 p.m.
          </p>
          <p>
            When they walked into the small waiting room with 16 chairs, a wall-mounted TV
            played an old television series before it later switched to Phineas and Ferb.
            Three sticky hand toys were stuck to the ceiling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lenzen checked in the three appointments and grabbed two clipboards, pencils
            and paper for the girls to draw.
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;He is like our grandfather, even though our grandfathers wouldn&lsquo;t be as
            patient,&rdquo; Zahra said. &ldquo;I love him.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            The erasers on the pencils weren&lsquo;t effective enough for the girls&lsquo; liking, so
            Lenzen sent them with Zahra to purchase better erasers at the Walmart next
            door. Zahra held Mehronaz&lsquo;s hand as they walked across the parking lot.

          <p>
            &ldquo;I&lsquo;d really like to go to Afghanistan,&rdquo; Freshta said as she walked
            in. &ldquo;It&lsquo;s been so long. I love my country.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            Zahra and Mehronaz led the way to the office supply aisle. They picked out a
            two-pack of Pen+Gear pink erasers. Mehronaz eyed a paint kit, but they settled
            for a pack of colored pencils. When they got in line to checkout, Zahra let
            them each have a MrBeast Feastables peanut butter chocolate bar. The total
            came to $5.92, which Zahra paid.

            Mehronaz danced and skipped the entire way to the waiting room. She said she
            wants to be a dancer and singer when she grows up. Freshta wants to be a
            doctor. Her favorite subject in school is math, but she found a talent with
            art, too.
          </p>
          <p>
            The girls spent the rest of their time in the waiting room drawing, playing
            the piano game and watching cartoons on the TV. Sorosh kept the Airpod in his
            ear and mostly stared at his phone. Zahra began braiding Mehronaz&lsquo;s hair
            before she was called back for her appointment.

            &ldquo;Should we use earplugs for Zahra?&rdquo; Lenzen asked the hygienist
            jokingly. They laughed.
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;She hasn&lsquo;t had a dental appointment in a while,&rdquo; he said.
            &ldquo;She&lsquo;s a little apprehensive.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            Lailoma and Amir came out to the waiting room about 30 minutes after Zahra
            went into her appointment. The dentist handed them dental care supplies with
            rubber ducks and sticky hand toys included inside. The kids started slapping
            each other with them, their mother giving them a look of disapproval with a
            slight smirk beginning to show.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mehronaz looked at the toys stuck to the ceiling as inspiration, as she
            managed to stick one right above where she was standing. Mischievously, she
            looked at her siblings.
          </p>
          <p>&ldquo;Now there&lsquo;s four,&rdquo; she said giggling.</p>
          <p>
            All three of the appointments lasted about an hour each and required Lenzen to
            schedule tooth extractions and fillings for Amir and Zahra. He paid their
            bills, which is a service RSN provides for families. RSN spends nearly $10,000
            each year for medical purposes, and a total of over $40,000 to help with
            various needs. The non-profit receives grants and donations from the city,
            local community foundations and charities to help sponsor the families.

            Zahid has been asked to perform several times at events since arriving in
            Bloomington. Two of his sons and youngest daughter have even joined, too,
            playing and singing a traditional Afghan song: &ldquo;Sarzamine Man&rdquo; by
            Dawood Sarkhosh, or &ldquo;My Land.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;I have become homeless,&rdquo; the lyrics translate to English.
            &ldquo;I have moved from one home to another. Without you, I have always been
            with sorrow shoulder to shoulder.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            Lailoma and Zahid gave up their livelihood to keep their family safe, but that
            meant starting again from nothing. Zahid wanted to start working right away
            but was encouraged to learn English before finding a job. He began work as a
            custodian for IU after five months of being in the U.S. They relied on
            financial support from Exodus and RSN in the meantime.
          </p>
          <p>
            His oldest son, 24, got a job as a custodian and still works as one today, but
            Zahid was let go after six months. He has not been able to find a job since.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not long after Zahid lost his job, his second oldest son, 19, started working
            as a custodian to help support his family&lsquo;s financial expenses, like rent,
            utilities and food.

            Refugees coming to Indiana over the age of 18 are typically unable to go to
            high school because of the 40-credit requirement to graduate, even if they
            need more of an education. They are encouraged to work and obtain a GED,
            Lenzen said. However, Zahid said his daughters are happy to go to school. They
            are on track to receive more of an education than they would be able to under
            the current Taliban rules. Girls in Afghanistan are not to have an education
            beyond sixth grade.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.unesco.org/en/emergencies/education/afghanistan">published by UNESCO</a> in December 2024, 1.4 million girls
            in Afghanistan have been denied access to secondary education since 2021.
            Although access to primary school is still available, 1.1 million fewer girls
            have been enrolled since 2019. Since December 2022, 100,000 Afghan women have
            been denied access to higher education.
          </p>
          <p>
            Zahra completed her undergraduate degree at IU (date) and began her graduate
            studies in international affairs (date). She wants to be an advocate for
            refugees who are having to completely transform their lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;This life is not luxury for us,&rdquo; Zahra said. &ldquo;This is not
            our dream.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            She had to leave behind a large family, festivals and celebrations. The
            transition to living alone, eating by herself and having to do everything
            independently is not the life she would have chosen.
          </p>
          <p>
            She said she desperately wants to see her parents and siblings again, to help
            them come to the United States, but she cannot go back to Afghanistan.
          </p>
          <p class="section-break">•••</p>
          <p>
            After the appointments concluded, they went one-by-one into the van.
            Lenzen punched in the directions to return to Bloomington, but
            offered an idea he knew the girls couldn’t resist.
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;Maybe we have stop at Wendy’s or something and get chicken
            nuggets,&rdquo; he said.
          </p>
          <p>Gasps came from the back seat.</p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;I know, here, this is Shams,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We’ll
            stop and get some Halal gummy bears.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>More gasps sounded, even louder than the last.</p>
          <p>
            Lenzen drove everyone to Shams Halal Market in Indianapolis, an
            Afghan owned shop that provides permissible and clean products
            according to Islamic law. It excludes products with alcohol or pork
            derivatives. Meat and poultry have to be slaughtered in a specific
            way to minimize suffering and ensure cleanliness.

          <p>The boys stayed in the car, but everyone else went inside.</p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;Do you want to get gummy bears?&rdquo; Lenzen asked Mehronaz.
          </p>
          <p>&ldquo;Uh, yeah,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Lailoma do you need something?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
          <p>She shook her head no.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Only gummy bears for them,&rdquo; he said.</p>
          <p>
            Zahra walked around the corner with Chilli Chatka chips, Slanty
            chips and a big smile on her face.
          </p>
          <p>&ldquo;These are my favorite snacks,&rdquo; she said.</p>
          <p>
            Freshta picked out a pack of Baldak spicy ramen noodles and went to
            find Slanty chips like Zahra. Mehronaz carried spicy ramen, gummy
            bears and two packs of fennel seeds for her mother.
          </p>
          <p>
            Zahra paid separately, but Lenzen paid for Lailoma. They piled
            everything on the conveyor belt where a young girl worked at the
            register.
          </p>
          <p>&ldquo;Do you go to high school?&rdquo; Lenzen asked her.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;What grade?&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&ldquo;The last year of high school.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&ldquo;A senior?&rdquo;</p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;I’m supposed to be a junior, but I am finishing a year
            early.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What are you going to do next
            year?
          </p>
          <p>&ldquo;College.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Ivy Tech or IU.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Well, good luck!&rdquo;</p>
          <p>
            They walked out of the store, into the van and began the journey
            home to Bloomington. The crinkle of the snack bags and crunch of the
            chips emerged immediately after turning out of the parking lot.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lenzen talked with Zahra about her life and asked her to help
            translate for Lailoma. From the first moment they met, he truly
            wanted to understand.
          </p>
          <p>
            The girls&lsquo; high-pitched singing voices started to overpower
            the conversations. They sang &ldquo;Round and Round,&rdquo; from the
            popular Netflix show Squid Game, &ldquo;APT,&rdquo; a K-Pop song by
            ROSÉ and &ldquo;Die With A Smile,&rdquo; by Lady Gaga and Bruno
            Mars.

            Lenzen arrived at Lailoma’s home at 4:49 p.m. The kids thanked him,
            pausing to say goodbye before exiting the van. He dropped off Zahra
            at her door but received a phone call from another family who needed
            to buy groceries. He said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; right away and drove
            them to the store.
          </p>
          <p>
            He didn’t get home until 8 p.m., typical for his job. He still made
            time to walk three miles around his neighborhood, something he tries
            to do daily to help his physical and mental health. It allows him to
            process how to help every family the best he can.
          </p>
          <p>
            He returned around 9 p.m., got ready to sleep and listened about
            halfway through the NPR News Hour before he drifted off. He was
            awake by 5:30 the next morning and out the door by 7 a.m.
          </p>

            His email signature contains a quote from author Amit Ray. It
            reminds him why he chooses to wake up each morning, work 12-hour
            days and be there for each text or phone call.

            we move towards a better world.&rdquo;
