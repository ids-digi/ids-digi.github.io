                    MINA #1
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the East Tower of Wells Library, a woman does something revolutionary. She sits at a desk and studies for her accounting midterm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mina traveled more than 7,000 miles to sit at a plain wooden table on a Wednesday afternoon and scribble equations on white copy paper. Thousands of Afghan women and girls risk their lives in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan to do just that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She unzips her backpack and pulls a swath of black silk. She carefully weaves locks of flowing black hair into a delicate knot, pins it with a gold hair clip and wraps herself in her hijab. She wants everyone in America to know she’s Muslim.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As she leans her small body over her laptop, a tendril of black hair slips out of her headscarf. It dangles over her round face, suspended in space. She releases a slow breath, and the tendril sways.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Everything is going to be fine,” she says.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mina’s seven gold circlet bracelets clink as she opens tab number 43 on her laptop. She’s studying on her new student visa. escape violence in Afghanistan and work for asylum status in the United States.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    When Mina’s almond-shaped eyes look up from her laptop, they’re not timid. She stares* at the world around her as if daring it to look back. If you take her challenge and look closely into the honey gold circles, you’ll see a broken pupil in her left eye. Black liquid spills down into her iris. An ink black teardrop frozen in time like a flower pressed in amber.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The tear is a glimpse into Mina’s past. The tears, blood, death, war, screams that will always be a part of her. Inked into her body and mind. But Mina doesn’t want to stay in that past. Time moves on, and she moves with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The shelf behind Mina is lined with volumes of faded maroon books with gold lettering: “Foreign Policy History of the United States.” One for each decade and each world region.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Her life course has been shaped by global forces like those in the books. But this Afghan woman does not want her life to be at the mercy of the history behind her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mina has her own story to tell. And as she sits at Wells Library, she writes the next chapter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    BACKGROUND #1: Nut section on recent refugees 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mina is one of over 30 Afghan refugees who have resettled in Bloomington since August 2021, according to [scheduling interview with Exodus Director Erin Aquino to confirm #]. Mina asked to be referenced by her first name only for fear her full name could jeopardize her application for asylum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After Afghanistan fell to Taliban forces following the United States military withdrawal in August 2021, tens of thousands of Afghans fled the country to escape violence. Chaotic scenes at the Kabul airport of Afghans rushing for evacuation flights captured global attention. Over a year since the last flight took off and the cameras stopped rolling, the lives of Afghan refugees go on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bloomington’s new Afghan neighbors are among the over 76,000 Afghan refugees who have arrived in America over the last ?? months. After months in refugee camps, now they’re resettling in cities and towns across the country.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a small brick apartment complex near the College Mall, one Afghan refugee family sits on the beige carpet in the living room of their sparsely-furnished apartment. The young couple asked not to be named for fear of compromising family members in hiding in Afghanistan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mina, who arrived to translate for the family, asks to hold the Afghan mother’s baby. “Salam! Salam!” she says to him, giggling as his tiny feet try to stand on the carpet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The mother, trying to calm the baby now cradled in her lap, explained her family’s harrowing journey out of Afghanistan. They were successful back home – she had just launched her career as a television news anchor. But this put her at risk when the Taliban took over Kabul. After weeks of missed flights, sleeping on the streets and living in hiding, they finally managed to get seats on a flight to a refugee camp in New Jersey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like most Afghan refugees in Bloomington, they came to the U.S. on humanitarian parole — an emergency legal status for people fleeing urgent conflict — as part of Operation Allies Welcome. Afghan refugees landed at one of nine refugee camps across the United States, including Camp Atterbury in Indianapolis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Camp Atterbury housed about 7,200 Afghan evacuees at its peak, according to [need to interview official], who have now moved into one of the 290 local resettlement communities across the country. In Indiana, resettlement agencies like Exodus Refugee have helped Afghan refugees find new homes in Bloomington, Muncie, Bloomington, Hammond, South Bend, Fort Wayne and Indianapolis, said Aquino [need to confirm].
                </p>
                <p>
                    After they arrived in Bloomington [??] months ago, the family seated round their beige carpet had to start from scratch while adjusting to a new culture in small-town Indiana.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their small apartment shows glimpses of their new life. A bike is parked in the dining room — the father bikes 10 miles to work at 5 a.m. every morning. The woman who used to address her nation as a news anchor in her native language, Dari, now holds up a video of an ABCs song on her phone to her baby.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She hopes to learn more English soon. She’s bored and isolated at home, she explained in Dari. Language is one of the many barriers facing Afghan refugees: they must find housing, secure employment, learn public transportation, navigate healthcare, maneuver the legal system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But she said starting over is worth it: she worked hard to get here so her children can have a better future in the United States.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She wants her daughters to go to school and get the education they would have been denied had they stayed in Afghanistan. Now, her oldest daughter attends a local elementary school. She dreams of being a doctor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [include another family’s story here]
                </p>
                <p>
                    MINA #2: How she got here (background story, cultural adjustment, challenges)
                </p>
                <p>
                    “This is bullshit!” a small voice pipes outside an exam room at McNutt Hall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A petite Afghan woman walks with the tiniest stomp in her step as she pushes through the front doors. She recounts the horrors of her [technology?] midterm exam with an exasperated smile on her face. “I’m going to fail,” she wails.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She walks quickly with no destination then plops down on the nearest bench and whips out her laptop to check her grades. Satisfied she won’t, in fact, fail, she checks an email from her advisor. There’s something called “tailgating” going on today, she reads.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Still huffing about her midterm, Mina wanders down Fee Lane then turns left towards Memorial Stadium. When she gets to the first grassy field, she dives into the crowd of cream and crimson tailgaters before her. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s a chilly fall morning on Homecoming Weekend --- much colder than Kabul. Deep booms of cannon blasts fall on Mina’s ears bundled under her knit hat, signaling the start of IU’s homecoming football game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tailgaters in the grass field around her erupt in unintelligible cheers and brandish their drinks. Mina keeps walking, her face perfectly still. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I get scared of those sounds,” she said softly, her eyes straight ahead. “They always remind me of bad sounds.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mina’s mind goes to bombs blasting off outside her window and rubbled city streets. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “In the beginning, it was very scary,” she said, recalling the day the Taliban took over Kabul. “The first day I was alone outside and I didn’t have a hijab. I thought, ‘if they get me today I’m not going to be alive.’” 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mina was coming home from her job at a government agency when she heard the news. She knew she was especially at risk since she’s a member of the Hazara ethnic and religious minority, who have been subject to systematic attacks and killings for centuries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, after she made it home that day, Mina only risked leaving her house to visit family for a whole year while living under Taliban rule. And only with her whole face and body covered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I felt like it was 10 years,” she said. “My whole life was destroyed.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mina rarely blinks when she talks. But she does when she recalls the day a school in her aunt's Hazara neighborhood was bombed [need to confirm which attack she’s referencing/more info].
                </p>
                <p>
                    And she blinks again when she recalls the news she read while studying for her midterms: another school was recently bombed in Kabul. Of the 19 students killed, most were Hazara teenage girls and women in their 20s like Mina. They were at a community learning center, determined to get an education after the Taliban banned girls from school.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Every day I open the news and every time I see news of something bad happening,” Mina said. “I cried a lot when I heard that. That makes me feel bad every day. I think, ‘why is this happening to us?’”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Human rights groups warn Hazaras are at risk of genocide in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. [zoom out: deep dive into Hazara history and why it’s so meaningful that Mina is getting her education]
                </p>
                <p>
                    On a [day of week? Time of day?] this August, after centuries of persecution against Hazaras, a Hazara woman arrived in Indianapolis on a student visa to study at Indiana University.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I saved myself, and I saved my future,” Mina said of her decision to leave Afghanistan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mina doesn’t dream of a future in America. She dreams of Afghanistan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “It all goes back to my country,” she said, eyes on Afghanistan. “I hope I can go home to serve people in my country and make people happy. I want to be the person to create that for people.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Until the Taliban are chased out of power and she can return home, Mina wants to be part of American life. She wants to go tailgating, make friends, watch football. She’s not taken aback by the grill dads, candy-striped pants, yard games, cheap beer, football jerseys. She smiles as she accepts mystery food items wrapped in aluminum foil (“I’ll try hotdog”) and high fives a row of children’s hands sticking out into the aisle. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Afghans are known for their hospitality with food, so Mina tries to be friendly. She walks up to tailgates and asks if she can have any of their food. A few say yes. But at this one, she’s met with tense smiles and averted gazes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    She walks away, unsuccessful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I think the food is just for their families,” Mina says.

                    BACKGROUND #2: Afghan community
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Afghan community had already taken root in Bloomington long before Mina arrived. Afghan immigrants have fostered community among themselves and become pillars of wider 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bloomington, including as owners of multiple successful local businesses.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the Square in Downtown Bloomington, a sign reads “Samira Restaurant” in bold red font.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inside the Afghan restaurant, Anwar Naderpool rushes back and forth between customers and the kitchen. He tends to the lunch buffet of traditional Afghan food: steaming basmati rice, roasted lamb, [what other foods? Look at avery pics]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Samira is a sign of the success* Naderpool found after he moved to the United States in 1994. After he fled his home country at 21 years old during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, he fled to Pakistan, got a visa to study in France, then met his wife in America. He settled down in Bloomington and opened a restaurant named after his oldest daughter, Samira, a few years later. [maybe dive into history: theme of foreign involvement in Afghanistan]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Naderpool said he’s faced few challenges in America. He worked hard, managed his money well and supported his family. But he worries for recent refugees. Their resettlement process is much harder than it was a few decades ago. It’s more complicated and expensive, he said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A few blocks away from Samira Restaurant, a white food truck with red lettering is parked on Kirkwood Avenue: “Doner Kebab,” it reads. Inside, a man with tan skin and salt-and-pepper-gray hair churns out gyros for a line of customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hamid Ali’s food truck, Doner Kebab, is another successful business launched by first-generation Afghan immigrants. Like Naderpool, Ali fled Afghanistan during the Soviet Invasion, made his way to the United States and started a business from scratch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ali forgets the line in front of him when he sees his favorite customer pedal her bike up to his truck.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Salam, Mina!” he exclaims, waving hello. When it’s her turn in line, he ducks into the truck and comes back with a plastic bag of Afghan bread his mom baked for Mina. He thrusts it into her hands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ali grins over a pile of french fries when he remembers the first day Mina stopped by his truck a month ago.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “On that same day I went home to my mom and told her ‘I saw a nice, friendly girl from Afghanistan,’ and my mom got excited, too,” he said. “She said ‘what is her name?’ I said, ‘Mina.’” 
                </p>
                <p>
                    He pauses, nodding as if “Mina” was a proclamation. “It’s saved in my head: Mina,” Ali says, tapping a gloved finger to his forehead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ali was excited to meet the newest generations of Afghan refugees. They’re a connection to the country he left behind 45 years ago. He wants to talk to Mina more, he said, to learn what it’s like in Afghanistan today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “The way she talks-” he breaks off, laughing as he leans back dangerously close to the spinning lamb behind him. “I want to keep her here to talk, but she always has to study,” he said, shaking his head with a tsk tsk. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ali, dejected, lays out a piece of naan slathered with tzatziki sauce then gingerly layers lettuce then lamb then more lettuce. He yells over the truck’s humming generator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I am impressed that someone like Mina exists,” he says, brandishing a gyro in his fervor. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    MINA #3: How she’s coping now (alone, misses family, wants friends)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mina pulls slimy orange pumpkin guts out of a pumpkin. Her seven golden bracelets clink as she flicks pumpkin guts off her hands. Her perfectly manicured nails are painted purple today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Flecks of pumpkin fall onto the two phones on the patio table. A woman’s voice comes out of one phone speaking quickly in Dari. The other has a picture of a Jack-O-Lantern on its screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Hmm, how should I cut it?” she says, squinting at the Google Images pumpkin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mina doesn’t have plans for her first American Halloween weekend besides carving her pumpkin. Like most every weekend, she stays home alone and calls her family. She’s met a few other Afghan refugee students like her, but otherwise she hasn’t made any friends on campus yet. Maybe they don’t want to be friends with her, she wonders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Maybe I’m wrong, but I realized on days I wear my hijab, they don’t want to talk to me,” Mina says.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When Mina gets on the bus to go home, she sees Muslim girls in hijab. They always sit alone. When Mina walks around campus, she sees Muslim girls in hijab. They always walk alone. Mina said she never sees them hanging out with friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When Mina goes to class, she waves hi and bye to her classmates, but they’re more acquaintances than friends. There’s one nice girl she talks to in her [???] class. Maybe they’ll talk more soon, Mina hopes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I feel homesick and isolated because I don’t have a good friend,” Mina said. “That’s the main problem that makes me feel isolated. That’s why I feel stressed.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    But it’s okay to be alone, Mina reassures herself. She’s strong. She’ll be okay. She still has her family. If only on her phone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mina carries her family’s voices inside as she grabs a pumpkin-cutting knife. When she carves out chunks of eyeballs and a triangle nose, another woman’s voice joins the call. It’s her older sister and her auntie, Mina says. Their voices rise into an argument. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Her auntie’s voice sounds distressed. “I don’t want her to die in a bomb blast at school. What should I do?” she says, according to Mina’s Dari translation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The auntie’s daughter, Mina’s 14-year-old cousin, dreams of going to art classes. But school is dangerous for Hazara children under the Taliban. Mina’s aunt, who still lives in Afghanistan with her children, fears her daughter could be another Afghan girl killed in a recent string of school bombings. She won’t let her go, she says on the phone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “No, don’t do that,” Mina’s older sister pushes back. “That’s what she loves.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The big sister on the phone advocated for Mina once, too. When Mina graduated secondary school in Kabul, she got a scholarship to attend university in India. Mina’s mom begged her not to go. She was scared for her youngest daughter’s safety. But Mina’s older siblings convinced her Mina could do it, so with her family’s support, Mina left home for India.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After her first semester, she got a call from her sister. Her mom was in a coma, she said. Mina made it home to Kabul just in time to say goodbye.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mina left her family for school once, and she just had to leave her family behind again. This time, she was forced to leave her elderly father alone in Afghanistan to study in America.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She dreams of the day they’re reunited, but for now Mina keeps carving her pumpkin, one ear listening to her phone’s speaker. Her sister is making leeway in the argument. Her aunt will send Mina’s cousin to school, her auntie finally decides.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their heated argument collapses into giggles and Mina tries to say goodbye, but now her auntie is chatting about something new. “She never stops talking,” Mina whispers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A child’s voice pipes up on the phone. Mina instantly leans in closer, leaning her cheek against the phone. She smiles a full tooth smile as her nephew’s voice blabbers on. She coos into the phone in Dari until saying goodbye.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Setting her phone down on the table, Mina holds up her finished pumpkin. “Looks good,” she says, smiling at the crooked orange grin. She snaps a picture and texts it to her family group chat.
                </p>
