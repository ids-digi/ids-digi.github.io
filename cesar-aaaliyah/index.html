                <p>Cesar, 18, sits in his room staring at the Ivy Tech Community College website. As an immigrant, his
                    temporary protected status has always been a source of constant anxiety, as it doesn&rsquo;t provide
                    permanent residency leaving him vulnerable to the threat of deportation. After the election, the
                    stakes seemed even higher. Donald Trump is promising new policies that could impact his ability to
                    stay in school and continue his life here in the U.S.</p>
                <p>This website is a first step to college for many, but for him it's a reminder of losing his
                    scholarship to Indiana University. Instead, he found himself here, navigating a different path.</p>
                <p>He stared at the screen, witnessing another block in his path to his education. The email from Ivy
                    Tech states they are still in the process of reviewing his application. Cesar has called Ivy Tech
                    several times since the end of October, and they had said to allow for seven days until his
                    application process.</p>
                <p>Seven days passed, and his application was still in a state of uncertainty. After the seven days
                    passed, he called again. Then, two weeks passed.</p>
                <p>Cesar has been here before.</p>

                <p class="section-break">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>


                <p>Cesar was 14 when he immigrated to the U.S. from Maracaibo, Venezuela in March of 2021. In 2019, a
                    five-day national blackout caused widespread disruption and fear, leading to increased violence and
                    looting across the country. Without a backup generator, Cesar, his mother, father and sister lived
                    in constant fear of becoming victims of the chaos. Following the blackout, they decided that the
                    deteriorating economy and corrupt government were enoughreasons to begin their immigration journey
                    to the U.S.</p>

                <p>Cesar&rsquo;s mother sold both of their cars, clothing and all the items that wouldn&rsquo;t fit in
                    their suitcases. They used the money to pay a coyote to take them to Maicao, Colombia. To cross into
                    Columbia, they had to pay a border patrol fee. Then, they took a bus to Barranquilla, Columbia as
                    there were only direct flights to the U.S. from there. They waited three days in a hotel for their
                    flight. They slept in a hotel eager but scared to go.</p>
                <p>The day arrived and the flight lasted five hours from Colombia to Florida. He sat with his sister who
                    was terrified of flights. He held her hand the entire flight while their parents sat in a different
                    row. Cesar listened to a playlist that consisted of mostly English based artists such as Tove Lo and
                    Adrienne Lenker.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;The whole flight I was thinking I don&rsquo;t know how to speak English. None of us know. How
                    are we going to survive?&rdquo; said Cesar.</p>
                <p>They landed at Orlando International Airport. Soon after landing, an officer stopped them and took
                    them to a room for questioning. The officer investigated Cesar&rsquo;s father due to suspicious
                    travel activity. His father had previously traveled to the U.S. for 6 months at a time to New York.
                    After Cesar&rsquo;s father stated that he was only visiting a friend, they checked their suitcases
                    and found nothing except clothing and leftover remnants of their life from Venezuela. Cesar&rsquo;s
                    family was cleared and let go. This was the moment Cesar first felt profiled.</p>
                <p>They went to their hotel and spent the week there before going to Indiana. Many of Cesar&rsquo;s
                    friends immigrated from Venezuela to Florida as it was the easiest state to travel to for many of
                    his friend&rsquo;s families. The first day he was there he was able to reconnect with some friends.
                    Later in the week his family came from Miami and visited them before their departure to Florida.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Orlando was so colorful and diverse it was exactly like how I imagined America. When I landed
                    in Indiana, it was grey and dark,&rdquo; said Cesar. &ldquo;There were barely any lights it was so
                    sad and dry.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>The family planned to enter the U.S. as tourists for a maximum stay of six months, after which they
                    would apply for asylum.</p>

                <p>To be eligible, applicants must provide valid proof of fear or oppression based on race, religion,
                    nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. They must fill out Form
                    I-589 and submit it within one year of arriving in the U.S. An initial screening and interview with
                    an asylum or immigration officer will determine acceptance or denial of entry. The asylum process
                    can be lengthy, as a mass influx of immigrants and refugees often causes many applications to be
                    delayed.</p>
                <p>As of July 3, 2024, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) had more than 786,000
                    affirmative asylum cases pending for more than 180 days, underscoring significant delays in the
                    process. The backlog is attributed to USCIS's insufficient funding, staffing and planning to handle
                    the growing number of asylum applications.</p>
                <p>As weeks, months then years went by Cesar began to question if their application would be approved.
                    Cesar&rsquo;s family has been awaiting their application to be approved since October 2021.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I always check the mail to see if there&rsquo;s a card, but I don&rsquo;t really expect
                    anything,&rdquo; said Cesar.</p>
                <p>Before the election, each news cycle brought fresh anxiety, and he worried about how changes in
                    leadership could further complicate his family's situation.</p>

                <p class="section-break">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>

                <p>Cesar stated that the election made him and his family nervous about their immigration status. He saw
                    that Donald Trump and his campaign had amplified false claims about Venezuelan immigrants in Aurora,
                    Colorado fueling stereotypes about migrants. He recently made unfounded accusations of Venezuelan
                    gangs taking over an apartment building in Aurora, Colorado.</p>
                <p>Immigration has been a central focus of Trump&rsquo;s campaign, appearing at nearly every convention.
                </p>
                <p>Last September, he stated, &ldquo;Following the Eisenhower Model, we will carry out the largest
                    domestic deportation operation in American history.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Trump claims that cities are becoming overrun by immigrants and that his mass deportation initiative
                    will begin with &ldquo;Operation Aurora,&rdquo; targeting gang-affiliated immigrants in Aurora.</p>
                <p>Trump plans to continue building the border wall and increase funding for border patrol. The asylum
                    process may become more restrictive, with new eligibility requirements and expedited deportations,
                    prioritizing American workers over immigration rights.</p>
                <p>Trump has selected South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to lead the Department of Homeland Security. If
                    confirmed, she would oversee Immigration and Customs Enforcement, among other agencies. Noem has
                    echoed Trump&rsquo;s talk on immigration and has been involved in rigourous immigration operations.
                    Noem previously supported Texas&rsquo; Operation Lone Star, a response to a rise in illegal
                    immigration in Texas, by donating $1 million and deploying South Dakota National Guard troops to the
                    U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
                <p>In a post on X earlier this year Noem said, &ldquo;Biden's open border policies are facilitating
                    illegal border crossings. This invasion must end. The federal government has to stop violating
                    federal law. And we need to go back to President Trump's successful immigration policies
                    immediately.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Cesar lives in fear that under Trump&rsquo;s policies, his family could fall victim to mass
                    deportations.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to get deported. I like my life here, and I don&rsquo;t see myself living
                    in my country again because of how I look and my mindset,&rdquo; Cesar said. &ldquo;Venezuela is not
                    my home. I will never be as happy as I am here than there,&rdquo;</p>
                <p>In Venezuela, Cesar felt self-conscious about both his queerness and his appearance, often facing
                    teasing from those around him because of his long hair. The constant mockery made him feel out of
                    place and isolated.</p>
                <p>He feels ashamed of the negative portrayals of Venezuelan immigrants in the news, as they ruin the
                    reputation of his community. Though he once struggled with his identity, Cesar is now beginning to
                    embrace it, finding strength in his experiences and the stories of others like him. He feels his
                    authenticity and his identity became solidified once he came to the U.S.</p>
                <p>He dreams of a day when he can feel secure in his place in America, free from the fear of deportation
                    or discrimination, but the political landscape makes that dream seem elusive.</p>
                <p>On Nov. 5, Cesar and 10 friends sat in Eigenmann Hall watching the election. They played games and
                    chatted occasionally to distract themselves from the tense atmosphere. Cesar felt uneasy, as if no
                    matter what they did, everyone&rsquo;s attention remained on him.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I felt the attention on me because my friends knew my temporary status and knew this would
                    have an impact on me,&rdquo; said Cesar. &ldquo;If Kamala won, I felt there would be a chance I
                    could go to IU and secure citizenship.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>As the night went on and Trump won Pennsylvania, everyone lost hope and went home. Cesar cried and
                    knew that there was no hope left. In the morning, Cesar checked the results and cried again after
                    learning Trump won. His thoughts since have been filled with how life would be if he had to return
                    to Venezuela.</p>
                <p>The sense of hopelessness only adds to his worries. Cesar has already felt the weight of helplessness
                    and limitations that come with being an immigrant, particularly through challenges in schooling.</p>

                <p class="section-break">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>

                <p>When he was a junior at Ben Davis High School, Cesar learned about Groups Scholars, a scholarship
                    program across all Indiana University programs for first-generation students, from a friend.</p>
                <p>To qualify for Groups, applicants must be residents of Indiana, U.S. citizens or green card holders,
                    maintain a minimum GPA of 2.5, complete 34 mandatory courses, and meet certain income requirements.
                </p>
                <p>Although Cesar is a resident of Indiana, he does not have a green card, which made him worry that his
                    status could complicate his application. However, he was ultimately accepted into both Indiana
                    University and the Groups program and applied to be a Cinematic Arts major.</p>
                <p>Once summer arrived, Cesar attended the Groups Summer Experience Program in Bloomington for seven
                    weeks. The program serves as a boot camp to help students adjust to dorm life, classes, and the
                    social aspects of college. He met many friends through the program.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;The whole experience was what I imagined college would be like. It felt like I was already a
                    student,&rdquo; Cesar said.</p>
                <p>After the program ended, however, Cesar began facing difficulties. The week before freshman move-in,
                    he had yet to receive his financial aid package and dorm assignment.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I called seven times, and the response was always the same: &lsquo;We&rsquo;re going to send
                    your financial aid package; just wait,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Cesar.</p>
                <p>On the morning of August 14, he received an email from Indiana University stating that his financial
                    aid could not be processed due to his Temporary Protected Status. Before telling his parents, he
                    reached out to the financial aid office, where a staff member connected him to a supervisor.
                    Although the supervisor checked in with him throughout the day, she couldn&rsquo;t provide much
                    assistance and advised him to wait until Friday for updates.</p>
                <p>When Friday arrived, a call confirmed that Cesar&rsquo;s scholarship had not been processed.</p>
                <p>Cesar and his mother cried together, and he struggled to keep himself occupied. He would watch films
                    all day. His favorite being &ldquo;Everything Everywhere All at Once&rdquo; because it explores the
                    feeling of being caught between multiple identities and world navigating cultural expectations,
                    personal desires, and societal limitations. Films could only help so much. He leaned on his mom and
                    friends for support. He texted his friends from IU, high school and Venezuela every night before
                    bed. His parents were devastated but not disappointed. They knew that being an immigrant came with
                    limitations and struggles.</p>
                <p>In the week following the news about his financial aid, Cesar slept with his mom every night. Unable
                    to rest, he would stay up talking to her for comfort, which helped distract him from his worries.
                    Cesar believed America was where his dreams would become real, but it seemed that this was being
                    taken away from him.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I felt like I finally could be my true authentic self in an environment like Groups and IU and
                    it felt like I was being punished,&rdquo; said Cesar.</p>

                <p class="section-break">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>

                <p>The Groups scholarship is processed through FAFSA, which requires a Social Security Number or an
                    A-number, a unique seven- to ten-digit identifier for immigrants. Without this number, financial aid
                    cannot be processed.</p>
                <p>FAFSA recently changed its application to make it shorter and easier, but many complications arose
                    from the new system. Students with parents who do not have a Social Security Number found it more
                    difficult to complete the form compared to previous years. The IRS Data Retrieval Tool also
                    experienced issues, making it challenging for families to access their tax information. While the
                    new form reduced the number of questions, it often increased confusion, with unclear language that
                    was easily misinterpreted.</p>
                <p>These problems resulted in a backlog on the FAFSA website, leading to slow loading times and frequent
                    error messages. As a consequence, the processing of FAFSA applications was delayed, prompting many
                    schools to extend their FAFSA deadlines and resulting in postponed financial aid packages for the
                    fall semester.</p>
                <p>The slow rollout of FAFSA verification and processing left Cesar's application in limbo, amplifying
                    his anxiety about the future. Each day brought a mix of hope and dread as he waited for clarity,
                    relying on his mother&rsquo;s support to help him cope with the uncertainty.</p>
                <p>Many immigrants suffer from the limitations of not having a social security number. &mdash;-</p>
                <p>In Bloomington, El Centro Comunal Latino provides a safe space for Hispanics in need of services and
                    community support. The center primarily focuses on Spanish-speaking individuals and immigrants,
                    helping with rent, utilities, mental health services, and groceries.</p>
                <p>In the summer of 1999, a group of university and community women gathered for lunch to discuss the
                    growing Latino population in Bloomington. All of them had something in common: providing support for
                    the Latino community. They worked as interpreters, translators, or by referring individuals to local
                    social service agencies that would best help their situation.</p>

                <p>Ana Cordero, the health projects coordinator, manages most activities and appointments at the center.
                    El Centro partners with organizations in Bloomington and Indianapolis that require Spanish-speaking
                    staff to assist clients. Most of the workers are volunteered based with Cordero being one of few
                    employees.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Many immigrants here face limitations because they lack a driver&rsquo;s license or Social
                    Security number, which restricts their mobility and opportunities. They can&rsquo;t solely rely on
                    public assistance,&rdquo; Cordero said.</p>

                <p class="section-break">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>

                <p>Being an immigrant comes with limitations, but Cesar and his family have worked hard to overcome
                    these challenges. Cesar has begun to take photographs professionally to continue improving his
                    skills in film and camerawork to build his portfolio for schooling and future work. He promotes his
                    photography primarily through word of mouth.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I would go up to people on campus and ask if I could take their photos. People would let me,
                    and I started getting business that way,&rdquo; Cesar said.</p>
                <p>Through these encounters, he not only honed his craft but also formed friendships. He met several of
                    his peers in the Groups program by asking them to pose for portraits. These interactions created a
                    domino effect, leading to more clients and expanding his network. His first major shoot was
                    photographing an engagement for a couple who specifically requested a gay photographer.</p>
                <p>The shoot was in late October and was significant to him, as it not only marked a milestone in his
                    career but also resonated personally.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;It gives me a hope I can find someone and a partner here,&rdquo; said Cesar. &ldquo;They have
                    a freedom of hiring a gay person for someone for their engagement. In my country, that would never
                    happen. I can see myself in them.&rdquo;</p>

                <p class="section-break">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p>

                <p>Cesar created a professional Instagram account to showcase his photography. His first post featured
                    the engagement photos, marking his first significant paid job. He is building a portfolio for
                    potential clients and jobs.</p>
                <p>Cesar was not given any official explanation for why his Ivy Tech application remained in limbo. He
                    was able to register and sign up for classes mid-November with an Ivy Tech advisor.</p>
                <p>He plans to study for a degree in Visual Communications at Ivy Tech next semester and if he is able
                    to secure financial aid, he hopes to transfer his credits to IU and stay on track for his degree.
