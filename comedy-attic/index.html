          <p>Behind the scenes of Bloomington's only comedy club stood its longtime puppeteer, Jared Thompson, 47. As
            the co-owner of Comedy Attic, Thompson wielded significant influence over the national comedy scene, hosting
            some of the biggest names in stand-up, including John Mulaney, Patton Oswalt and Nikki Glaser.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>Now, that era has come to an end.</p>
        <p>Thompson, co-founder of Limestone Comedy Festival, has privately stepped down from the Comedy Attic following
          multiple allegations of sexual harassment and emotional manipulation. The resignation was confirmed by
          screenshots of text messages sent on Feb. 26 to employees. It is unclear if he has stepped down from the
          festival.</p>
        <p>Despite relinquishing his leadership role, Thompson said he will continue to book headliners for the club.
          His wife, Dayna Thompson, who co-owns the club and owns Caveat Emptor, will assume the rest of his
          responsibilities according to the screenshots.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Since these accusations have surfaced locally, many employees/former employees have approached me with
          surprise, saying they are shocked and did not feel he (Jared Thompson) ever crossed a line with them.&rdquo;
          Dayna Thompson wrote in an email to the Indiana Daily Student.</p>
        <p>Eleven individuals have confirmed with the IDS that Thompson repeatedly abused his position of power during
          his 17-year ownership of the comedy club to target numerous women, including four who were nearly 20 years
          younger than him at the time of their experience.</p>
        <p>Chey Navarro, 30, was one of several women who was subjected to Thompson&rsquo;s misconduct.</p>
        <p class='section-break'>•••</p>
        <p>In 2022, Navarro and her husband began working at the Comedy Attic. Her husband, who requested to remain
          anonymous, was a regular performer, while Navarro served as the club&rsquo;s operations manager.</p>
        <p>From her first day on the job, Navarro said Thompson used his position to create opportunities to be alone
          with her, often making intrusive comments about her personal life, sex life and marriage.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;From the get-go I was very adamant that this was not okay,&rdquo; Navarro said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
          want to talk about this. You&rsquo;re my boss, this isn&rsquo;t appropriate.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Despite Navarro setting clear boundaries on numerous occasions, Thompson dismissed her concerns and continued
          his unwanted advances in private or over the phone – ensuring little to no physical evidence of harassment.
        </p>
        <p>Thompson frequently called Navarro when his wife was away at work or out of town, sent her photographs of
          women in lingerie and nude and asked her not to tell anyone the things he told her, especially not her
          husband.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;This man has such control in the comedy industry,&rdquo; Navarro said.</p>

        <figure class="wide-left">
          <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ids/5a264bb2-36d7-4c2b-904e-95b68f87f2b7.original.png" />
        </figure>

        <p>She said she felt trapped because Thompson could retaliate against her husband&rsquo;s comedy career.</p>
        <p>Thompson&rsquo;s power stretches far beyond the walls of the Comedy Attic. As co-founder of
          Bloomington&rsquo;s nationally recognized Limestone Comedy Festival and the gatekeeper of Indiana&rsquo;s
          premier comedy club, he holds the careers of aspiring comedians in his hands &mdash; including Navarro&rsquo;s
          husband.</p>
        <p>Navarro and her husband are expecting their first child this year. She said Thompson even asked about her sex
          life during pregnancy.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;As your belly gets bigger, you&rsquo;re going to have to change up your sex
          positions,&rsquo;&rdquo; Navarro said. &ldquo;And then he would say, &lsquo;Your boobs are going to get
          bigger.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Navarro said Thompson would purposefully try to create distance between her and her husband from the
          beginning, telling Navarro that he&rsquo;s mean to her and she deserves better. He also insisted that if she
          was having any marital problems, she could come to him because she could trust him.</p>
        <p>On one occasion, Thompson called her husband the &ldquo;luckiest guy in the world.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Thompson booked Navarro&rsquo;s favorite comedians to headline at the club after asking who her preferences
          were. He also complimented her body and showered her with expensive gifts such as a watch and massages.</p>
        <p>Thompson told Navarro that his wife was unaware of the gifts he gave her.</p>
        <p>Navarro said all of these actions were part of a larger problem of manipulation that ultimately undermined
          the very values Thompson claimed to uphold at the club. She tried to deny all the gifts and consistently
          expressed how uncomfortable his advances made her.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Never once was he told that he had made someone feel uncomfortable or like he was making advances
          toward them,&rdquo; Dayna Thompson wrote in an email to the IDS.</p>
        <p>Both Jared and Dayna Thompson said they have strived to make the Comedy Attic a supportive environment for
          women and all other under-represented groups in the community, while Navarro directly disagrees. As an Asian
          American, Navarro said she was the only non-white employee during her employment.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;This just scratches the surface of years of sexual harassment and power abuse and manipulation,&rdquo;
          Navarro said. &ldquo;By somebody who's built their entire reputation and the club's entire reputation on
          female empowerment and creating a safe space for women, all while abusing them behind closed doors.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Thompson&rsquo;s resignation from the Comedy Attic came less than two months after he revealed in a small
          staff meeting Jan. 21 that he was having an affair for six months with a female comedian who worked at the
          club. According to sources in attendance, he tearfully told employees he was leaving his wife to be with the
          comic.</p>
        <p>While many staff members rallied behind their boss, Navarro had a different reaction.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t fathom a tear because it was such a stunt,&rdquo; Navarro said. &ldquo;To see
          everybody just accept it made me want to throw up.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class='section-break'>•••</p>
        <p>Navarro was one of many women in the revolving door of Thompson&rsquo;s pattern of inappropriate
          relationships. According to several witnesses, he consistently exploited younger women, both comics and
          employees, for emotional and personal validation.</p>
        <p>In 2013, a female comedian, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of harming her reputation, began
          performing at the club when she was 18. She said Thompson, then 40, quickly took an interest in her.</p>
        <p>He took the young performer under his wing, encouraging her to pursue comedy full-time and offering her more
          stage time than experienced comedians.</p>
        <p>In a male-dominated industry, women who receive Thompson&rsquo;s attention are often given more
          opportunities, which isolates them from the rest of the comedians. x</p>
        <p>"He gets you to be jealous of and hate each other and be competing with each other, so that he can remain
          king," the comedian said.</p>
        <p>Stephanie Lochbihler, 41, started performing at the Comedy Attic in 2012. Although she did not experience
          Thompson&rsquo;s favoritism herself, she witnessed his cycle of predatory behavior since she began doing
          stand-up at the club.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He latches onto younger, vulnerable women,&rdquo; Lochbihler said. &ldquo;He creates competition among
          them, and then when they&rsquo;re no longer useful to him, he moves on to the next one.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>In 2017, Thompson became fixated on another young female comedian, who also requested to be anonymous. At the
          time, she was 20 years old. Thompson shifted his attention from the previous comedian to her.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He would say to me, &lsquo;You just understand me better than anybody else in the world, even my
          wife,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said.</p>
        <p>She said her time at the Comedy Attic was in the midst of a hard time in her life, and Thompson was the
          closest relationship that she had.</p>
        <p>The comedian performed at the venue until 2021 when she started experiencing recurring panic attacks, many
          triggered by Thompson&rsquo;s presence in the audience.</p>
        <p>When she reflects on her relationship with Thompson now, she claims he groomed her.</p>
        <p class='section-break'>•••</p>
        <p>Tracy Luther, 29, was never officially employed at the Comedy Attic but has assisted with small tasks around
          the club since 2018. He said he witnessed Thompson&rsquo;s harassment firsthand.</p>
        <p>Luther said Thompson had a lot of &ldquo;younger female best friends&rdquo; that he was very close to before
          it started to click that this pattern of behavior by Thompson had been occurring for years.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that he (Thompson) would think that he is trying to be harmful to someone,&rdquo;
          Luther said. &ldquo;But, his actions are very manipulative.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>He also observed Thompson asking female employees in the kitchen if their breasts got &ldquo;in the
          way&rdquo; of anything or how they managed to find shirts that fit.</p>
        <p>Both Jared and Dayna Thompson said staff conversation at the Comedy Attic is often &ldquo;bordering on the
          inappropriate,&rdquo; and that they rarely participate. Dayna Thompson claims that both she and Jared
          Thompson&rsquo;s sexualities have been questioned because of it.</p>
        <p class='section-break'>•••</p>
        <p>In July 2024, Thompson confessed his feelings for Navarro in the privacy of the green room, the place where
          comedians and staff lounge before and after shows.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;Things are getting increasingly more difficult for me,&rsquo;&rdquo; Navarro said.
          &ldquo;&lsquo;I know that I have everything that I need in my life to make me happy, but the only thing that I
          want is you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Navarro said Thompson then told her that he was willing to leave his wife for her, and that he knew people
          would be upset by the news, but he couldn&rsquo;t deny himself this happiness. For 20 minutes he spoke to her,
          saying he didn&rsquo;t just want this to be an affair.</p>
        <p>She told him she didn&rsquo;t feel the same way, that she had never felt the same way.</p>
        <p>He said he didn&rsquo;t believe her.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;I can tell by the look in your eyes, you're saying one thing, you mean something
          else,&rsquo;&rdquo; Navarro said.</p>
        <p>When Thompson asked her what she wanted, Navarro answered that she wanted a marriage and a future with her
          husband. She said she made it clear to Thompson that she had never reciprocated his feelings, and that she
          would not continue her employment at the Comedy Attic if his behavior continued.</p>
        <p>Thompson told Navarro that any time he&rsquo;s with his wife and children, he would rather be with her.</p>
        <p class='section-break'>•••</p>

        <p>In the six months following his confession to Navarro, Thompson would leave the Comedy Attic early, asking
          close friends and staff to cover for him. Jonas Schrodt, 40, was one of the people tasked with managing the
          club in Thompson&rsquo;s absence.</p>
        <p>Thompson told Schrodt he left to watch his daughter play the dulcimer.</p>
        <p>In reality, he was secretly having his affair in a parking garage, which he told staff at the meeting when he
          announced his affair according to Navarro.</p>
        <p>Schrodt performed at the Comedy Attic since 2011 and became known as the &ldquo;Fifth Thompson&rdquo; due to
          his close affinity with the owner and his family.</p>
        <p>It wasn&rsquo;t until after news broke about Thompson&rsquo;s secret relationship that Schrodt realized the
          pattern of behavior. Looking back now, Schrodt can name a list of women Thompson has done this to.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a serial predator, if not an active predator,&rdquo; Schrodt said.</p>
        <p>Following Thomson&rsquo;s announcement of his affair, several current and former employees aired out their
          longstanding grievances about the owner&rsquo;s behavior on Jan. 22 during a group call. Comedy Attic
          co-manager and Thompson&rsquo;s business partner, Mat Alano-Martin, was present for a portion of the call.</p>
        <p>Navarro said Alano-Martin listened to Schrodt recount the years of Thompson&rsquo;s inappropriate behavior
          toward women. Schrodt named a list of women and said there had been a pattern of this conduct for years, which
          Alano-Martin was also present for.</p>
        <p>According to Schrodt, Navarro and Lochbihler, who were all on the call, Alano-Martin disregarded their
          concerns and implied Thompson&rsquo;s actions were none of their business. He left before the call concluded.
        </p>
        <p>Schrodt has since stepped away from the Comedy Attic and cut ties with Thompson.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed of myself for playing any part in facilitating this,&rdquo; Schrodt said in an email
          to Thompson. &ldquo;Your actions have destroyed a place that was sacred to me. You&rsquo;ve sullied the
          thousands of joyful memories I have of that place, and most importantly you&rsquo;ve irreparably hurt people I
          love.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Alano-Martin spoke of Thompson&rsquo;s affair on Jan. 28 during his podcast, &ldquo;Mat and Dwight Just
          Might&rdquo;, with co-host and comedian Dwight Simmons. Simmons is a comedian and a co-director of the
          Limestone Comedy Festival alongside Alano-Martin and Thompson.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I understand there are people that are legitimately hurt, but I also think there are people who are
          overreacting and that&rsquo;s not helpful for anybody,&rdquo; Alano-Martin said on the podcast.</p>
        <p>Simmons agreed with Alano-Martin&rsquo;s comments on the podcast.</p>
        <p>The next day, Veronica Casillas, 26, approached Alano-Martin after an open-mic at the club. She had performed
          at the Comedy Attic since April 2023 under Alano-Martin&rsquo;s mentorship.</p>
        <p>After her set, she told him in the green room she no longer wanted to continue working at the Comedy Attic
          amid the claims of sexual harassment and the ethics of Thompson&rsquo;s affair.</p>
        <p>Casillas, Navarro, Schrodt and Lochbihler said they believed Alano-Martin knew of the abuse long before they
          voiced it to him.</p>
        <p>On Feb. 23, comedian Max Haddad made a post in the Indianapolis Comedy Scene Facebook group in response to
          the podcast episode. Haddad was never employed by Thompson but had heard of his behavior from other local
          comedians.</p>
        <p>The post criticized those who pride themselves for protecting women but turn a blind eye when holding their
          friends accountable. Initially, he did not explicitly mention any names.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Indianapolis, your comedy scene will not be healthy until the hypocrisy stops and the people are held
          accountable,&rdquo; Haddad said in the post. &ldquo;Many individuals are to blame…I&rsquo;m calling it out. My
          friends are calling it out. I invite you to join us.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>The post garnered many comments, some backing Haddad while others asked for additional context because they
          believed it was solely about Thompson&rsquo;s affair.</p>
        <p>The next day, Haddad made another post, identifying Alano-Martin. In the comments, he specified he was also
          talking about Thompson.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;These people are completely disingenuous. The list of victims isn&rsquo;t limited to one person. If
          you believe anything they say, you are buying into a PR campaign run by people who are concerned for
          themselves,&rdquo; Haddad wrote.</p>
        <p>Both of Haddad&rsquo;s posts were taken down by the group's administrators, but not before people in the
          Facebook group began discussing Alano-Martin&rsquo;s role in excusing Thompson&rsquo;s abuse of power.</p>
        <p>Following the Facebook posts, Alano-Martin reached out to Navarro, Lochbihler and Schrodt, among others,
          claiming he was never aware of the pattern of manipulation and the severity of Thompson&rsquo;s behavior.</p>
        <p>On Feb. 26, Alano-Martin sent a group text message to around 20 Comedy Attic regulars and staff.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Jonas (Schrodt) expressed how hurt he was by Jared&rsquo;s (Thompson) affair and what he referred to
          as a series of previous emotional affairs,&rdquo; Alano-Martin wrote. &ldquo;I felt all of this fell under the
          category of no one&rsquo;s business other than Jared and Dayna (Thompson).&rdquo;</p>
        <p>While Alano-Martin claimed he was unaware of the grooming allegations in these messages he sent out, others
          feel they made it very clear to him.</p>
        <p>Alano-Martin has been working alongside Thompson at the club since 2009, and it opened in 2008. Every woman
          Thompson has had an &ldquo;emotional affair&rdquo; with has worked below him, including the woman he was
          meeting in the parking garage.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s been trying to do this the whole time and he finally just found somebody to take
          him up on it,&rdquo; Navarro said.</p>
        <p>To Navarro, speaking out about her experience with Thompson was not about his infidelity. It was about the
          years of sexual harassment and protection he received not only from his peers, but the comedy scene as a
          whole.</p>
        <p>In August, Navarro is expecting her first child. Initially she said she was worried the pregnancy came at the
          wrong time, but now she thinks it&rsquo;s the perfect time.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m bringing a daughter into the world, I want to set a good example for her…I want her to
          know that I did what I could to try to put a stop to it and to give a voice to all the women or the
          victims,&rdquo; Navarro said.</p>
