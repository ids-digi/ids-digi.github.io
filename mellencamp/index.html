              When the IU rep got to the art studio in Indianapolis,
              John Mellencamp had half a face.

            <p>
              Michael McAuley is a sculptor, an immortalizer. He insists he must
              take his time sculpting people or else they may end up mangled,
              like so many realistic bronze figurative sculptures.
            </p>
            <p>
              Precision takes time, and that is what McAuley told Adam, one of
              the reps who commissioned him for the Mellencamp sculpture made of
              bronze. Adam smiled at the half face of Mellencamp.
            </p>

            <p>“That&rsquo;s John,” he said</p>

            <b>Sculpting requires more tools</b>, a live model to pay out of
            your own pocket, the patience to fail and try again. Not many
            people can do what he does, especially when only given a
            photograph to work from, and when the person you are hoping to
            bring to life is still living and will personally evaluate it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The statue was unveiled in Bloomington’s campus on Oct. 18 of this
            year. Mellencamp made an appearance for the occasion, smiling for
            photos and singing a few songs for those who gathered.
            Mellencamp’s bronze figure now rests forever outside the IU
            Auditorium next to Hoagy Carmichael, his left arm holding the neck
            of his acoustic guitar and his right arm held up, ready to strum.

            When McAuley sculpted Carmichael for IU in 2008, he had complete
            artistic freedom. He got to choose the age in which he would
            appear, the pose he deemed most Hoagy-like.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Mellencamp assignment was much stricter. His agent gave
            McAuley a photograph taken recently and said this is how he wanted
            to be depicted. This was after McAuley had already prepared a
            presentation where he explained the public might find it more
            iconic to see a young Mellencamp as he was creating his hit songs.
          </p>
          <p>
            McAuley saw Mellencamp in concert once or twice, he can’t
            remember. They are only three years apart in age, with McAuley
            turning 70 this year, and both have been residents of Bloomington.
            The sculpture is what ultimately tethered them together. He knew
            he couldn’t mess this up.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I respect Mellencamp as an artist, as a songwriter, because you
            know me, I use clay,” McAuley said. “And he uses words like I use
            clay.”
          </p>

            <b>His mother a creative</b> and his dad a mathematician, the
            values of art and perfection were instilled in McAuley when he was
            born.
          </p>
          <p>
            “With my father, everything was black and white,” McAuley said.
            “There are no gray areas. When he would shovel the snow off the
            driveway, it had to be a perfectly straight line. No snow on the
            pavement, always on the grass.”
          </p>
          <p>
            McAuley knows no life without art. His mother and grandmother were
            always painting and crafting. He drew a lot in high school and
            worked with clay when he could. During those years, he bought
            motorcycle parts from his friend for $25 and put it together
            himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The motorcycle was a machine, 3D,” McAuley said. “And clay, I
            could make anything I wanted out of that clay. So, after making
            that motorcycle we will say, and enjoying the freedom, it gave me
            the freedom I have in art. It brought me great exhilaration.”

                The plaque honoring John Mellencamp with lyrics from his hit
                song “Small Town” is embedded in stone by his statue at the IU
                Auditorium. Mellencamp received an honorary doctorate from the
                university in 2000.

            <b>For years</b>, he rode on the wooded trails behind his home,
            occasionally venturing onto the road. He described it as freedom,
            wherever it would take him.
          </p>
          <p>
            He sold his motorcycle to go to college for art and hasn’t ridden
            one since.
          </p>
          <p>
            In college at IU, his pottery classes were his favorite because he
            enjoyed the manliness of working with his hands and making
            mistakes, changing and adding things to the clay as he worked.
          </p>
          <p>
            The beginnings of a bronze sculpture are in clay. McAuley sculpted
            Mellencamp with it, then sent it to a foundry to be cast in
            bronze.
          </p>
          <p>
            McAuley says that setting a sculpture cast in bronze is difficult,
            especially in the midwest, because it is essentially a desert for
            foundries. You must find a foundry you trust, which is where they
            melt bronze and pour it into a cast after they have melted the wax
            out of an intermediary plaster form.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once finished, few adjustments can be made; it will remain as it
            is forever. This is his reputation. This is his livelihood.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pressure to make his sculptures perfect wakes him up at night.

          <p>
            <b>To ensure accuracy</b> and to confirm his reputation of being
            an artist of high integrity, McAuley hung up posters outside his
            bathroom door showing the anatomy of a human ear and the muscle
            groups of the face. No two ears are the same, but he says they all
            share a certain unity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ears and the face are the hardest to get right. If you get the
            face wrong, you get the person wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sculpting the body of a person is easy enough, if you have a model
            to stand still for you. The model must have the same body type as
            your subject and be willing to wear whatever clothes they are
            given.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finding Mellencamp’s body, however, proved to be a great
            challenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            McAuley stood across the street from the nearest Starbucks for
            hours to scout out someone willing to do the job. He was turned
            down by every guy he found whose body could resemble the famous
            singer’s, feeling humiliated. Eventually, someone responded to his
            Facebook notice.
          </p>
          <p>
            He didn’t mind so much that the model’s body didn’t match - he was
            able to sculpt his legs and cut them down from there, and he used
            his knowledge of anatomy to change the body type to Mellencamp’s.

            Down the hall from the bathroom, a room with glass windows and a
            sliding door sits cluttered with art, some finished and some
            awaiting his delicate hand. The room smells of paint with no

            <b>He is relieved</b> to be done with it, proud of what he
            produced. He now works on a piece for an art show, a circular
            clay sculpture he calls Madonna and Child based on the sculpture
            The Virgin and Child with Infant Saint John by Michelangelo
            himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            McAuley takes inspiration from Michelangelo, as all great
            sculptors do. He is a Christian, like him. He prays for the good
            of the world and the safety of his mother. He prays for himself
            and his nation, for the good that he wants to see in everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            He sculpts with a photograph of Michelangelo’s original Virgin
            and Child sitting on the table beneath him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Michelangelo’s piece depicts a young Jesus laid in the arms of
            Mary with a young John The Baptist holding out a baptismal bowl
            to her. McAuley’s takes the same circular shape, but instead is
            set on a beach with Mary wearing a swimsuit and baby Jesus snug
            inside an inner tube with goggles on his head. John The Baptist
            is awaiting to take full shape, but when he is finished he will
            bare a mischievous grin and tease Mary with a locust.
          </p>
          <p>
            McAuley’s hair is gray. His tools are tiny, silver and sharp.
            The table they rest on is covered in a blue tarp, stained in
            clay. He works slowly, sometimes listening to the radio to avoid
            the starkness of silence. His choice of rhythm is light,
            classical or jazz or ‘70s music.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was listening to the radio the day he feared most for his
            reputation.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was the morning broadcast of his favorite Indianapolis
            station, and the two hosts were talking about the new John
            Mellencamp statue down in Bloomington.
          </p>
          <p>
            They said the statue didn’t look like him. That is the worst
            thing a figurative sculptor can hear.
          </p>
          <p>McAuley emailed them immediately.</p>
          <p>
            “I said, I listen to you every morning, I love your commentary
            on life and politics, but I really think you missed the boat on
            this one,” McAuley said. “I was given a photograph to work from,
            and here is a picture of him right beside the head. People are
            influenced by you and what you say. I wish you had done more
            research before you made a comment on something you are
            aesthetically ill prepared to comment on.”
          </p>
          <p>
            He kept listening to the station in the following mornings in
            hopes they would retract their statement, but if they did he
            didn’t hear it. He has seen similar remarks in the comment
            sections of news articles.
          </p>
          <p>
            He wishes people had studied the aged version of Mellencamp’s
            face as he had. He knows he followed the photograph exactly. He
            knows the statue is one he should be proud of because Mellencamp
            himself thanked him.
          </p>
          <p>
            The letter from Mellencamp was short, but it was all he wanted.
            It read: “Michael, thank you for your work, and your eye, to the
            sculptor.”
          </p>
          <p>
            As he worked on Mellencamp, he viewed his anatomy references
            time and time again, walking back and forth between the door and
            the studio where John stood atop his platform. In the hallway
            between them, sculptures of his past line the walls.
          </p>
          <p>
            During his bathroom breaks, he could reach for the aged book
            atop the toilet bowl which detailed the lives and artworks of
            famous sculptors like Michelangelo and Raphael.
          </p>
          <p>
            When he washed his hands, he could read the bible verse he taped
            to the bathroom mirror: “He who humbles himself will be exalted
            - and he who exalts himself will be humbled.”

          <!-- <b><i> -->
          With the Mellencamp profits, part of his compensation went into
          savings and the other part was reserved for non-essentials. He
          never married, never had children. He is free to do as he
          pleases with the funds and his free time.
