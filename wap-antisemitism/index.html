Esse accusantium ab expedita tempore inventore distinctio eum reprehenderit, totam excepturi temporibus!</figcaption></figure></div><p>It had happened Sept. 29, just a few days prior: an IU student, accused of tearing down a <span class="image-link animated" data-anim-class="animate-underline" data-image-link="mezuzah">mezuzah<span></span></span> – an important Jewish scroll – off of the apartment door of two other Jewish students and partially burning it. </p><p>Maya still remembers the feeling of shock that ran through the room. As a Jewish woman, she’s no stranger to antisemitism. Even when it’s not directly targeting her, it’s part of the territory that comes with being who she is. But even if it’s never surprising, that never makes it easier — especially when it happens in a place she should be able to call home. </p><p>For Jewish students, the reality is that antisemitism is not a rare occurrence, on campus or in general. </p><p>According to a survey by the Anti-Defamation League and Hillel International, nearly one-third of Jewish students experienced antisemitism on college campuses during the 2020-21 school year. </p><p>The burned mezuzah was not the first, nor will it likely be the last incident. The university does what it can to support students, but it doesn’t always feel like enough. And it can’t stop the other students, community members, celebrities and politicians that perpetuate and add to the problem. Jewish students must find ways to keep going, through everyday instances of antisemitism like offhand comments and bigger incidents like the burned mezuzah. </p><p>To cope, they come together. </p><p>They pray. </p><p>They vent.</p><p>They have Shabbat dinners and do Torah study and attend temple. </p><p>They try to educate others. </p><p>They hang mezuzahs on their doors. </p><p>They practice their faith in private and in public, even when it could be risky.</p><p>Above all, they remain proud. </p><p>Maya wears a Star of David necklace around her neck. On her bedroom wall hangs the Israel flag. Although it can be challenging, she tries not to get discouraged. The hate, she said, ultimately brings her closer to her community and closer to God. </p></div><div class="image-featured"><figure class="glass-card animated" data-anim-class="animate-in"><img src="./assets/dev/select1.jpg"><figcaption class="animated" data-anim-class="animate-in">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.

She then washes her hands three times with a special hand-washing cup, a ritual known as netilat yadayim in Jewish law. After brushing her teeth and getting dressed, she does a few morning blessings and prays to set the tone for her day. </p><p>Since coming to college, Maya has grown deeper in her faith. Growing up, her family was heavily involved in Jewish culture; she attended Hebrew school, went to a Russian Jewish heritage synagogue and took a trip to Israel for her bat mitzvah gift. But aside from the formal schooling and traditions, the spiritual side of Judaism and the teachings of the Torah weren’t a major part of her life growing up. </p><p>As a junior in high school, she participated in a Jewish Russian women’s research internship that sparked an interest to learn more. Coming to IU gave her the opportunity to do so. </p><p>IU has a vibrant Jewish population. Hillel, IU’s official Jewish culture center, estimates Jewish students make up 12% of the entire student body. Spaces such as Hillel and Chabad – a Jewish outreach organization on campus that Maya’s attended chapters of since childhood – offer community, celebration and support to Jewish students.</p><p>As a senior in high school three years ago, Maya had her heart set on attending IU. A business major, she’d heard good things about the Kelley School of Business, and felt an immediate connection with Hillel when she visited campus. She could tell the big building got frequent student traffic, and its presence alone was reassuring of a strong Jewish community. ‘This is going to be home for me,’ she thought.</p><p>Raised by Russian parents who’d left the Soviet Union due to antisemitism, Maya and her sister, Leah, were raised to be unflinchingly proud of their Jewish identities. She grew up in a self-described ‘Jewish bubble;’ her hometown of Glenview, Illinois, had a large Jewish population, and she grew up attending Hebrew school, going to a Russian-Jewish synagogue and celebrating traditions like her bat mitzvah. She knew antisemitism happens everywhere, but direct antisemitism wasn’t a big part of her life. Most of the time, she felt safe. </p><p>When she was searching for colleges, she knew she wouldn’t thrive in a place with frequent, egregious antisemitism, which is what she didn’t hear about at IU. </p><p>What she couldn’t have known was that was about to change. </p><p>The incident with the burned mezuzah was closer to her than she’d imagined. </p><p>It happened at The Avenue, an apartment complex on North College Avenue in Bloomington. Maya, now a junior at IU, had lived in that building during her sophomore year. Larena Guberman and Mya Levy, the students who lived in the apartment and owned the mezuzah, were acquaintances of Maya’s. </p><p>Already having begun the hunt for a senior year apartment, Maya thought about living at The Avenue again. It was convenient, and she knew the area. She was shaken by the incident, but decided to sign the lease anyway, hoping for the best. </p></div><section class="interview"><div class="container"><div class="top"><div class="speakingCard"><img src="./assets/dev/select7.jpg" alt=""><div class="speaker"><div class="name"></div><div class="subhead">Speaking</div></div></div><div class="title"><div>Interview</div></div></div><div class="video"><div id="player1" class="player" data-youtube-video-id="ScMzIvxBSi4"></div></div></div></section><div class="story"><div class="section-break"></div><p class="dropcap">College is supposed to feel safe. It’s supposed to be a place to thrive, safe for everyone no matter their religion, race or anything else. In a majority-red state, Bloomington, Indiana is hailed as a safe haven. But what happens when it’s not? </p><p>In the past year, Bloomington’s Jewish community has faced an onslaught of antisemitic acts that have left Jewish students reeling. They’ve been threatening and repeated and can seem too many to count: in December 2021 alone, six different swastikas were found around the city. </p><p>Before that, four mezuzahs — important Jewish scrolls inscribed with religious texts – were ripped down from the doorways of dorm rooms during Rosh Hashanah. </p><p>And so far in 2022, along with the burned mezuzah came antisemitic comments published on an anonymous Greek life website. In an effort to try to combat the frequency and severity of the incidents, members of Hillel even created an Antisemitism Task Force in 2021, after a string of torn-down mezuzahs that semester. </p><p>While members of the Jewish community say there’s been an uptick in the sheer number of antisemitic acts, antisemitism itself isn’t new to Bloomington. Over a decade ago, rocks were thrown through the windows of Hillel, IU’s Jewish culture center. In 2019, the campus chapter of Pi Kappa Phi was suspended after video footage emerged of 11 members physically assaulting three members of Alpha Epsilon Pi, a traditionally Jewish fraternity. </p><p>In June of this year, Bloomington business Above Time Coffee Roasters faced criticism after using what many said was Nazi imagery and language. The owner, Sarah Dye, admitted to posting in an online chatroom that perpetuated white supremacist ideology. </p><p>In February, IU’s Jewish community was shaken after a series of antisemitic comments were posted to the website GreekRank, an anonymous online forum for the discussion of Greek life on campus. </p><p>The comments, posted under the screen name “the truth,” were directed toward Jewish fraternities Zeta Beta Tau, Sigma Alpha Mu and Alpha Epsilon Pi. They accused Jewish students of taking advantage of women, and advised IU women to stay with “the people you belong with.” </p><p>“As a community we need to come together and be aware of everything that these kids are about. Money, greed, and sexually assaulting women,” one of the comments read. “Their families are in positions of power therefore they get away with everything and are not scared. And then ofc our women go to them to take their alcohol and that’s when the Jews capitalize on their victims.”</p><p>The posts, which included more graphic and explicit commentary, were deleted from GreekRank at the university’s request, but screenshots remain on Twitter and Instagram. </p><p>Jewish organizations including Hillel, Hoosiers for Israel and Chabad condemned the comments in statements posted to social media. IU Provost Rahul Shrivastav said in a press release that the event was deeply upsetting and disappointing, and there is no place for hate or violence in the IU community. </p><p>Shortly after the comments were posted, members of IU’s Jewish community went to Jewish Greek houses to place mezuzahs on the doors in support. </p><p>However, this wasn’t the first issue of antisemitism on the website — in 2018, another antisemitic comment claimed IU’s campus was being “taken over” by Jewish students and made racist comments about their appearances and behavior. This comment was also credited to an anonymous user, operating under the screen name “OKAYY.” </p><p>Gunther Jikeli is the associate director of IU’s Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism, which was established in 2009. The institute offers a program of courses, lectures, conferences and publications that aim to determine which expressions of antisemitism are new and what has been inherited from past antisemitism. </p><p>The institute has published multiple reports, books and studies on antisemitism, including a report from June 2022 studying antisemitism in social media. The study found that in 2019, 6.9 percent of conversations about Jewish people on Twitter were antisemitic, totaling 849,253 antisemitic tweets. This number rose to 1,531,912 antisemitic tweets in 2020 — or 10.7 percent. </p><p>Social media, Jikeli said, often plays a big role in perpetuating bias and discrimination because much of today’s socialization happens online, making it easier to disseminate antisemitic ideas and rumors. </p><p>But the problem is far-reaching. Much like in Bloomington, America’s past year as a whole has proven to be hit after hit for the Jewish community as antisemitism sweeps the country on a broader scale. Increased antisemitic acts and rhetoric have peaked, sparking fear amongst the Jewish community not just at IU but across the nation. </p><p>According to the American Defamation League, antisemitic incidents reached an all-time high in the U.S. in 2021, with a total of 2,717 incidents of assault, harassment and vandalism reported to the ADL. This is the highest number of incidents on record since the ADL began tracking in 1979. And these are only what’s reported. </p><p>Rapper Kanye “Ye” West made antisemitic remarks earlier this year, a saga beginning in October when he donned a shirt with the slogan “White Lives Matter,” a statement commonly linked to racism and white supremacy ideals. He was dropped from his partnerships with multiple companies in the following days, but acts of antisemitism often inspire one another:  Toward the end of October, images went viral that showed a group of demonstrators on a Los Angeles freeway overpass. Arms raised in a Nazi salute, they stood behind banners that read “Honk if you know” and “Kanye is right about the Jews.” </p><p>With the addition of antisemitism fueled by the Israel-Palestine conflict and the stress of election season, it all creates terrifying parallels. A reminder that no matter where Jewish people go, they aren’t guaranteed safety.</p><div class="section-break"></div><p class="dropcap">Not all antisemitism is so direct. A lot of it happens throughout everyday life, scattered in instances that sting at best and serve as reminders of trauma at worst. </p><p>Sitting in the Indiana Memorial Union one day during freshman year, Maya overheard a group of girls say their favorite conspiracy theory was that Jewish people made up the Holocaust. Stunned, she covered her Hebrew laptop sticker with her hand. </p><p>While walking down Kirkwood Avenue with a fellow Jewish friend last year, two women sitting in a car at a stoplight yelled antisemitic comments out the window. Is this how some people see me? She thought. </p><p>Later that year, news spread of a swastika painted onto a building near Sixth and Lincoln streets Dec. 4. It was the first of six to come in the following three weeks, and would ultimately be one of two in just the same day. </p><p>It was also during Hanukkah. </p><p>The Shabbat weekend had ended, and Maya was scrolling through Instagram, catching up on what she’d missed. Another Jewish student had posted about the swastika. When Maya saw it, even through the screen, she instantly felt anxious.</p><p>The next day, she saw it herself. She’d coincidentally decided to take a new route to Wells Library from her apartment at The Avenue — the building where the mezuzah would later be burned — and came across the building while walking. </p><p>She got shaky; her adrenaline kicked in. </p><p>“My body just shut down as I was walking past,” Maya said. “It was so freaky.” </p><p>She called her mom, who knew firsthand what her daughter was feeling from her time facing antisemitism in the Soviet Union. Her mother told her to be careful, but also not to forget where she came from: a community and family proud of their Jewishness. </p><p>Maya started to think about the reaction the group at Chabad had, the positivity they’d practiced. In the day since the swastika was painted, measures had been taken to confront the incident and begin the healing process: after discovering the symbol, leaders from Chabad responded by holding a service in front of the building, where they lit a menorah and sang in honor of Hanukkah. The swastika had quickly been covered, painted over the same evening. </p><p>But despite the square of bright white paint that stood out against the greyish wall, Maya still felt scared. She knew what lay under that white paint. </p><p>“What that symbol means is, ‘We want you dead.’ That’s what I think when I see that,” she said. “It’s not safe, it’s not welcoming, and that was in the Bloomington community.” </p><p>To stay safe, Maya carries mace and tries not to walk alone at night. Occasionally, if she feels particularly afraid, she hides her Star of David necklace underneath her shirt. </p><div class="section-break"></div><p class="dropcap">When asked about vandalizing the mezuzah at Larena Guberman and Mya Levy’s apartment, Jeremy Patzelt said he didn’t know the people in the apartment were Jewish, or that the mezuzah was a Jewish symbol. What he did, he said, was the result of ignorance and a lack of proper judgment. </p><p>While walking on Sept. 29, he said he saw what he assumed to be a note encased in a plastic tube. Curious, he tore it down to take a look. After opening the mezuzah’s case and realizing the contents were religious, he decided to leave the mezuzah at the doorstep in an effort to return it. He said he didn’t realize at the time the offensive message it could send. </p><p>“I’d like to greatly apologize to my Jewish peers, friends and just the whole community of Jewish people on campus that felt hurt or felt fear by the actions,” Patzelt said.</p><p>He was ultimately charged with two counts of criminal mischief in October. </p><p>When asked to comment on Patzelt’s apology, Maya said she doesn’t buy it. </p><p>“It literally has Hebrew on it,” she said. “How do you look at that and just think it’s decoration?” </p><p>The people behind the GreekRank comments or the swastika on Sixth and Lincoln remain unidentified. While it’s unknown whether any of these incidents were connected, they’re all indicative of a larger anti-Jewish sentiment, Maya said. And for her, each incident feels the same: like a slap in the face. </p><p>“Every time I feel maybe safe or comfortable or I’m just going about my day not worrying about being Jewish, it’s a reminder, like, ‘You’ve got to be careful.” </p><div class="section-break"></div><p class="dropcap">Besides Hillel and Chabad, Jewish students often find support by creating it themselves.</p><p>A few days after the mezuzah burning incident, members of the Antisemitism Task Force held a meeting. The smell of paint wafted through the dining room at Hillel, where the group painted wooden mezuzah cases red for their ongoing mezuzah project, which offers free mezuzah cases for non-Jewish allies to place on their doors in solidarity. </p><p>They chose red, task force co-chair Kaylee Werner said, because it stands out. It makes sense—if antisemitism is loud, support must be, too. </p><p>Werner is in the process of creating an antisemitism plan of action — a document detailing how students can respond when antisemitic events are reported. </p><p>The first step in the plan, Werner said, would be to contact a member of task force leadership. That person would then reach out to the victim of the incident to ask them what kind of support they need. Next, with permission, they’d post about the incident to social media and spread the word to help prevent another instance. </p><p>When Jewish students are threatened, other Jewish people are often the only ones to speak up.</p><p>“It’s gotten to the point where if it’s not going to be anybody else, it has to be us,” task force co-chair Jared Cohen said.</p><p>Like most other Jewish students, Hillel president Zeevie Drizin has had her share of experiences with antisemitism. Besides the swastikas drawn on desks and bathroom stalls throughout grade school, one experience that stands out to her happened during her freshman year at IU. Hillel was having Rosh Hashanah services outside on the front lawn, when a person driving by yelled out the window, “Heil Hitler!” </p><p>The experience jarred her, but like Maya, she wasn’t surprised, even though she feels she should be. She knows that what she heard was similar to what members of her family heard in concentration camps. Even though the Holocaust happened decades ago, the intergenerational trauma of it lives inside her, too. </p><p>For Holocaust Rememberance Day, Hillel set up tables in Ballantine Hall and the Indiana Memorial Union to educate students and encourage them to get involved with Hillel. She’s also worked with Greek life on antisemitism programming, and collaborated with IU’s Union Board to host a Pledge Against Antisemitism event in the IMU, where people could sign their names on a poster reading “I stand against antisemitism.” That poster, filled edge to edge with signatures, now stands inside the front hallway at Hillel. </p><p>Drizin said she thinks the response to antisemitism tends to be more reactionary than anything, especially among non-Jewish students. She thinks that when an incident of bias happens, people are passionate for a short time, but quickly move on. </p><p>Maya believes most people don’t take antisemitism seriously enough. While her own non-Jewish friends support and empathize with her when antisemitic events occur, overall she thinks people often boil Judaism down to just a religion, something people can choose whether or not to participate in. But in reality, it’s an ethnicity, a culture and a family. </p><p>“I think because people misunderstand who we are, they misunderstand the severity of antisemitism,” she said. </p><p>Sue Silberberg is the rabbi and executive director at Hillel. A fixture of IU’s Jewish community, a major part of her job is supporting Jewish students in their day-to-day lives. </p><p>In her 30 years of being at IU, this past year is the worst she’s seen in terms of antisemitism. While there’s always been some one-off incidents, recent events have been more severe and prolonged. Silberberg said the GreekRank comments, for example, were some of the worst she’d ever seen. </p><p>“I think a lot of people felt unsafe and targeted,” she said. </p><p>She attributes the uptick in antisemitic incidents in part to the current political climate and the former presidency of Donald Trump, who has perpetuated anti-Jewish tropes. Although many people have held these viewpoints, they are now more likely to speak out, she said. </p><p>Silberberg thinks education is crucial in preventing antisemitism. People may know about Judaism generally, she said, but they often know little of what it actually involves or the extent to which antisemitism affects others. </p><p>But it can be difficult to make long-lasting change. Each class of new students must be reeducated, and each new class brings the risk of antisemitism all over again. </p><p>When students inform her of an incident, she can help them with things like contacting police, working with residence halls or just being someone to listen. </p><p>Often, she senses fear, hurt, anger and confusion from students.  Silberberg tries to encourage them — she believes there are more good people who want to be Jewish allies than those who don’t. But she felt scared and discouraged for a long time, too. She tries to focus on the progress that’s been made, like seeing politicians who have pushed antisemitic rhetoric be defeated, and on mobilizing the community to support those affected by antisemitism. </p><p>“It’s hard to be Jewish off by yourself in a corner,” she said. “Because community is so much a part of who we are as Jews.” </p><p>But she knows that antisemitism persists, even when people speak up about it. She said she thinks it’s not enough to simply remember things like the Holocaust. What’s most important, especially now, is action. </p><p>“We have to use that memory of what happened to inspire us to continue to fight against it,” she said. </p><p>She just hopes people will learn from the past. </p><div class="section-break"></div><p class="dropcap">Antisemitism follows Maya everywhere.</p><p>Even back to her hometown, where she felt relatively safe growing up. This past May, she experienced one of the most jarring instances of antisemitism at a library in Chicago where she went to do homework one day. </p><p>In the study room next to her, two boys were talking, and she heard one of them mention Hitler. Taken aback and curious to know more, Maya stepped close enough to the room to peek at the boys. One of the teens opened the door of the study room. </p><p>“Kill the Jews!” he yelled. “Hitler! Hitler! Hitler!”</p><p>Maya stood there in shock. What just happened? </p><p>She doesn’t know for sure that the words were directed toward her, but thinks they were. Like in the incident at the stoplight, she’d worn her Star of David necklace that day, and she also has a Jewish sticker on her laptop. </p><p>Ultimately, though, it doesn’t matter, she said. Whether taught at home or from the internet, the words they said and the intention they carried came from somewhere. </p><p>While the words hurt, Maya said the worst part of the situation was what happened afterward. Sobbing, she approached the librarian to tell her about the incident. She hoped the librarian would make an effort to talk to the teens and potentially educate them, but the librarian simply asked them to leave. </p><p>Maya wishes she knew where those kids ended up. She didn’t want them to get in trouble; she just hopes they’ll be educated somewhere down the line about why their words were wrong.</p><p>Just like she did after passing the swastika on the street, Maya called her mother to tell her what happened. She thought of the parallels between what she’d faced and what her mother went through in Russia — like being beaten for being Jewish. </p><p>“She came to this country so that her kids wouldn’t have to experience things like that,” Maya said. “And I just felt her heart breaking.” </p><p>Maya said she and her family have had conversations about leaving the U.S. should antisemitism become too extreme. They’re not the only ones. Many Jewish people across the country have been rethinking how to stay safe in a country where hate against them only seems to increase. </p><p>“We definitely know that if shit hits the fan, we’re not staying,” she said. </p><p>Her parents know their limit; they’ve left and come back once before, in an effort to outrun a beast as old as Judaism itself. Maya said if policy changes were introduced within the government that oppressed Jewish people, going back to Israel — a place she’s visited twice before and where some of her family reside — is an option she’s okay with. </p><p>“It definitely feels special there as a Jew,” she said. “Like, this is your ancestral homeland. This is where you belong. This place will always come to save you if your countries kick you out again.” </p><div class="section-break"></div><p class="dropcap">Maya’s best friend Kim Gabriel actually did leave campus to escape antisemitism. </p><p>Like Maya, Kim wanted to be part of a Jewish community on campus. Shortly after her freshman year began in 2021 , she checked out Hillel and Chabad as places to be with her peers and practice Jewish traditions. </p><p>Kim, who is Black and Jewish, began feeling out of place as the only person of color in those spaces. With only one other Black student and only one other Jewish student on the floor, she began feeling out of place as the only person of color in those spaces. What started as an attempt to make friends turned into a torrent of racism and antisemitism. </p><p>White floormates shouting the n-word through the Black students’ doors. Taping pennies to the doors of Jewish floormates. Heiling Hitler. </p><p>One person scattered ripped-up pamphlets from Hillel around the bathroom. Another made a swastika on the floor out of toilet paper. </p><p>Scared of the situation continuing, but also of retaliation, Kim first tried to educate her floormates.</p><p>“You can’t just come back two-times heavy and ready to start a war, because that’s just going to cause  a lot of damage,” she said. </p><p>Rabbi Sue held a required bystander intervention meeting for the floor. During the meeting, Kim said, the people who were responsible for the majority of the issues weren’t taking it seriously, laughing and looking at their phones instead. </p><p>Shortly after that meeting, Kim was shown a group chat where some people from her floor were sending photos of themselves heiling Hitler and talking about Nazis. </p><p>Kim realized the education wasn’t as effective as she’d hoped. Since she had proof like photos and text messages, she ended up reporting the situation to the university, who she said kicked everyone in the group chat off their floor of Eigenmann and moved them to a different floor. She said the bias response team met with each of the students in the group chat to sort out who did what. Kim said some of them were later placed on academic probation as a consequence of their actions. </p><p>Even those who were her friends at the time got angry at her for reporting. You were wrong to report. They didn’t mean it. If you were there after the meeting, you would’ve seen that they were sorry. </p><p>This resulted in even more text exchanges, including a physical threat. She avoided reporting again out of fear for her safety and because she’d been gaslighted by the other students. </p><p>When the university moved her floormates, Kim was given an entirely new housing assignment in Wright, to allow her space from the incident. After moving into her new dorm for second semester, she had to start over with a new social construct. She began meeting up with Rabbi Sue for coffee and took an antisemitism research class, which gave her the opportunity to spread awareness. </p><p>But coping with what happened was difficult while also worrying about typical college things like deciding on a major and completing schoolwork. Kim eventually decided to go online for her sophomore year. She now lives in South Africa with her family and takes classes part-time.</p><p>Since that year, she’s come back to campus twice to gauge how she felt about potentially returning. The experience still haunts her: whenever she sees people who look even remotely like those who harassed her, she has flashbacks. She now only feels comfortable in Black and Jewish spaces at IU. </p><p>She hopes to return to campus at some point during her college career. But for now, she’s focusing on healing and enjoying her classes in peace. </p><p>“I’m trying to have that time now that I didn’t get back then,” she said. </p><div class="section-break"></div><p class="dropcap">Maya said that overall, she feels like the administration as a whole tries to do what it can to support Jewish students. She said she has felt supported by various faculty members, and appreciates acts of solidarity like moving exam dates to allow for holiday observances. </p><p>However, she wishes there was more transparency on IU’s side in the process of holding other students accountable for their actions. She said she wishes the student who burned the mezuzah had been expelled, for example. But even though she understands that some instances of antisemitism happen anonymously, it would be comforting for IU to be more transparent about their attempts to uncover the culprits.</p><p>“I understand why they wouldn’t discuss everything that they’re doing, but I feel like it would help if they did,” she said. </p><p>Maya never reported the incident involving the women at the stoplight to the Bias Response Team because she didn’t have evidence, and doubted there was much to be done. She did report the two women discussing anti-Jewish conspiracy theories in the IMU. However, she said she didn’t receive an invitation to talk about what happened or any kind of follow-up communication.</p><p>Cedric Harris is the director of bias response at IU. He strives to be victim-focused in his work. But punishing those who commit acts of bias isn’t a cut-and-dry process. If a student is determined to have violated IU’s Code of Student Conduct, they are directed to the Office of Student Conduct to handle the situation. Other situations, like threats of harm, are reported to the university or city police department. But if the person accused is anonymous — like in the GreekRank incident — or otherwise unidentifiable, Harris is limited in his ability to confront or punish them. </p><p>Freedom of speech is also a factor. While hate speech can cause mental anguish, it’s difficult to expel or otherwise punish students based on only their speech, Harris said. </p><p>Even though she knew submitting a bias report wouldn’t stop people from thinking a certain way, Maya said she would have appreciated some sort of response. But just letting someone know she experienced it helped. </p><div class="section-break"></div><p class="dropcap">Jewish students cope with the antisemitism they face in a variety of ways. </p><p>Senior Sonia Nussbaum takes a selfie with every swastika she sees. It's a way to reclaim power, to make herself laugh in situations that would normally just be depressing.</p><p>For Maya, coping comes by finding solace in her community. Every Saturday morning, she studies the Torah with Rabbi Levi at Chabad. and she’s the president of the Business Leadership Initiative at Hillel. She also dresses more modestly than she used to, a personal choice that helps her feel more connected to God. Her journey with faith is heading toward where she’s always wanted it to be. </p><p>“I think about myself differently. I’m more confident. I think before I speak a little more,” Maya said. “I feel like I’m just more intentional with everything I do and the details.”</p><p>During Yom Kippur this year, Maya sat in services at Chabad and watched as hundreds of fellow Jewish people filtered in. Each time she turned around, she saw the room more packed than it was just a few minutes before. Turning to her friend, she said excitedly: “There are so many Jews here. It’s so amazing.” </p><p>Maya knows that even when it feels like others don’t care, she has friends she can lean on who have heard the same remarks, had the same experiences, felt the same sadness and anxiety and anger she has.</p><p>She now has a semester to go before she returns to The Avenue, where the mezuzah was torn down and burned in September. As antisemitism rages across both Bloomington and the U.S., Maya has much to consider: how to practice her faith safely in college. How to reckon with the effects of antisemitism. Where to place her own mezuzah next year. Right now, it rests safely in the doorway of her apartment at Union Street Center. </p><p>She hasn’t made the decision yet; she’s waiting to see how she feels in the moment. She suspects she’ll probably be more scared than she is now. </p><p>But Maya is determined not to let antisemitism stop her from living her life on her own terms. She wishes people would take antisemitism more seriously. She knows that she has to keep her Jewishness in mind when she makes decisions, to protect her peace and safety. But at the end of the day, the hatred only strengthens her relationship with her community, with Judaism, and with God. </p><p>“That’s when I’m proudest to be Jewish,” she said. “Feeling like I’m part of something bigger than myself.” </p><p>Maya thinks about what her community has survived in the past. Just as hate endures, so must faith. </p></div><div class="scroll-container"><div class="scroll-sticky"><section class="quote"><div class="container"><div class="glass-card glass-interactive"><div class="glass-cursor" name="glassCursor"></div><div class="headline"></div></div></div></section></div><div class="scroll-sticky"><div class="quote-2"><div class="container" style="display: none"><div><div class="quotation">“</div>We will always outlive the people who hate us.</div><div style="animation-delay: 2s">We outlived the Babylonians.</div><div style="animation-delay: 4s">We outlived the Nazis.</div><div style="animation-delay: 6s">We outlived everyone and we will continue to.</div><div style="animation-delay: 8s">And we do that through pride.</div><div class="credit" style="animation-delay: 10s; animation-duration: 5s">&mdash; Maya Goldenberg</div></div></div></div></div><div class="story"><div class="author-bios"></div><p class="donate"><em>Like what you're reading?</em><br>Support independent, award-winning student journalism. <a href="https://www.idsnews.com/page/donate" target="_blank">Donate</a>.</p></div></article></main><footer><div class="footer-row"><div class="logo"><a href="https://idsnews.com"><svg viewBox="0 0 163.17 68.85"><path style="fill: #990000" d="M0,67.77V1.08H19.89V67.77Z"/><path style="fill: #990000" d="M32.85,67.77V1.08H58.32c19.44,0,38.34,6.21,38.34,33.3,0,26.64-20.07,33.39-39.6,33.39ZM52.74,50.4h5.85c12.06,0,17.91-4.41,17.91-16s-5.67-15.3-18.81-15.3H52.74Z"/><path style="fill: #990000" d="M98.82,59l9.54-13.59c6.66,4.59,15.93,7,23.31,7,9.45,0,11.7-2.16,11.7-4.86s-2.7-3.78-12.51-4.59c-14.31-1.17-28.26-4.86-28.26-21.15C102.6,5.67,115.83,0,131,0c15.84,0,24.48,4.05,29.16,7.83l-9.9,14.31c-3.78-2.52-12.33-4.77-19-4.77s-8.73,1.08-8.73,3.69c0,3.24,2.79,4.05,12.69,4.86,14.94,1.26,28,4.14,28,20.7,0,13.5-11.52,22.23-30.87,22.23C114.66,68.85,105.84,64.53,98.82,59Z"/></svg> <span class="show-desktop">| Indiana Daily Student</span></a></div><a class="subscribe show-desktop" href="https://www.idsnews.com/page/newsletters" target="_blank">SUBSCRIBE</a><div class="socials"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/idsnews" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/idsnews" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/idsnews/" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-instagram"></i></a> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2XFEmhbtKuLVV6tAJl7Lx3?si=h1A1_1ETSL-GVcjgRqynqw&nd=1" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-spotify"></i></a></div></div><div class="links"><p><a href="https://www.idsnews.com/page/contact" target="_blank">Contact us</a></p><p><a href="https://www.idsnews.com/page/employment" target="_blank">Employment</a></p><p><a href="https://www.idsnews.com/page/policies" target="_blank">Policies</a></p><p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/ids/45e13f9c-6411-4947-8db6-2bf00b0e8d93.original.pdf" target="_blank">Advertising</a></p><p><a href="https://issuu.com/idsnews" target="_blank">Print edition</a></p><p><a href="https://www.idsnews.com/page/contact" target="_blank">Write to us</a></p></div><p class="copyright"><small>All content &copy; 2022 Indiana Daily Student</small></p></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="js/bundle.min.js"></script></body></html>
